<p>The upper link is the starting page of my IERG4210 project GitHub static web page which is a shopping website. <br>
I use semantic HTML throughout the whole assignment and separate the CSS and JS code from the HTML. <br>
  <br>
There are two categories: New Balance and Nike. <br>
Users can choose the band to see the related product. <br>
  <br>
I use the “CSS tableless” product list which is Flexbox. <br>
Each product includes its thumbnail, name, price, and addToCart button. <br>
When the thumbnail or name is clicked, it will redirect to the corresponding product page. <br>
After users click on the addToCart button, the shopping list will be updated. <br>
  <br>
Moreover, there is a hover shopping list on both the main and product pages to display the added product, quantity, price, and total price. <br>
When it is displayed, it will cover any elements behind it. <br>
Also, there are input boxes for each added product which are used for inputting the quantity of each selected product. <br>
A checkout button will be used to submit the list to the Payment page and go to the Payment page. <br>
  <br>
In the Product page, it provides product details: bigger image, name, description, price, and addToCart button. <br>
After users click on the addToCart button, the shopping list will be updated. <br>
  <br>
Both main and product pages include a hierarchical navigation menu. <br>
Users can click on the page name, it will redirect users to an upper level of the hierarchy and the corresponding page. <br>
  <br>
After clicking on the button "Click to clear Shopping List" on the Payment page, the shopping list will be cleared. <br>
  <br>
Finally, I host the static web page with GitHub. <br>
